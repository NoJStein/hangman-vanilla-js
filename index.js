/*

- Should start with a row of buttons on top for the difficulties
- Once a difficulty is selected, a random word is chosen
- The player can input letter
- If the letter is in the word, reveal that letter
- If it isn't, add to the representation of a hangman
- If they lose, show a lose message
- If they win, same thing, say they won
- When the game is over, have a play again message and show the buttons again

- Should have the remaining and used letters visible in a grid
- If the letter has been guessed and is not in the word, grey it out
- If the letter has been guessed and is in the word, color it green, yellow, whatever, make it stand out

- The hangman should have an emoji for his head
- It should react to what happens in the game
- If you guess a correct letter: ðŸ‘€ðŸ˜„
- If you guess a wrong letter: ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜±
- If you win: ðŸ¥³
- If you lose: ðŸ’€
- If the hangman is still alive and the player hasn't made a move for 15 seconds, have him fall asleep or look at them funny: ðŸ˜´ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¤
